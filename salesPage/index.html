      <p style="font-size:2rem;color:grey;font-family: arial;">People generally categorize their day to be a good or a
        bad day and let's be honest we generally do some superstitious shit whether its eating curd before going for the
        exam or keeping a fast or simply praying to the god in order to make our day a well spent but maximum times as
        usual our day does not go as per our accordance instead we always face challenges for which we aren't prepared
        at all.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:2rem;color:grey;font-family: arial;">Have you wondered why is this phenomenon happening in
        your regular life?

        surrounding always say something about your problem.During childhood we were usually told to stay away from fire
        so that we won't get burnt, or to avoid eating ice-cream so as to not to fall sick.<br>But what happens is when
        we think or focus on the problem or you can say the negative stuff it gets fixed into your subconscious
        mind......Even if you don't want to attract those negative things they eventually gets attracted. </p>

        beginner's Guide to Visualization</p>

      <p style="font-size:2rem;margin:0rem 4rem;margin-top:2rem">Visualization relies on the concept of the Law of
        Attraction. The Law of Attraction states that whatever our mind is focusing on is what we are most likely to
        attract into our own lives.The basic principle is that the things we think will eventually begin to shape our
        reality. So if we are fixated on the negative, we will attract more negative. But if we Focus on the life that
        we most want to live, then that is what we will attract to ourselves.</p>
      <p style="font-size:2rem;margin:0rem 4rem;margin-top:2rem;font-weight:800">But people have misconception that The
        law of attraction is only about attracting things by thinking. No this is wrong !! There are lot of things you
        will find in this course which will break your stereotype about The Law of Attraction.</p>

          of attraction for over five years and thought I truly grasped what The law of attraction was all about.I have
          read all the stuff by the various gurus only to see my personal growth lay dormant and do absolutely nothing
          in terms of progression.Your dynamite information, touched or connected with something inside me and your
